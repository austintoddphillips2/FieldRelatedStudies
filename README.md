This is a collection of some of the work that i have done in college, used to show my ability in data analysis, and R/SAS Coding



Credit Card Fraud analysis was a project I completed in fall of 2025. It is an exploratory analysis, where we evaluate different models for detecting credit card fraud and try to optimize for sample size, while still getting sufficient results. There are 3 files, one with all code used (written in R), one with the final report, and another with a presenation. This was a completely open-ended project and all choices made in the analysis were of my own volition.


Longitudinal Data Analysis final was a final report for a course where we wanted to determine the behavior of dropout for patients taking a medication. The questions for the final were specifically tailored and told us exactly what models/graphs to use. the final report looks extremely sloppy and is not well written, however it was laid out how the professor wanted it for the course, as he was looking to grade on code implementation and not presentation of information.


The exploritory well data was a final project i submitted for a computational methods class. in it, I use logestic regression and iterative functions to explore a dataset on bengaladeshi well water. this was another project that was heavily directed and told us what models we should be using.


Fightsimutil is an exerpt of one of the utils from my self-developed game, MMA EMPIRE. This game was largely created using AI, and shows my ability to leverage AI to an extensive level. I plan to release this as a free to play game by spring of 2026.
