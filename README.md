This is a collection of some of the work that i have done in college, used to show my ability in data analysis, and R/SAS Coding



Credit Card Fraud analysis was a project I completed in fall of 2025. It is an exploratory analysis, where we evaluate different models for detecting credit card fraud and try to optimize for sample size, while still getting sufficient results. There are 3 files, one with all code used (written in R), one with the final report, and another with a presenation. This was a completely open-ended project and all choices made in the analysis were of my own volition.


Longitudinal Data Analysis final was a final report for a course where we wanted to determine the behavior of dropout for patients taking a medication. The questions for the final were specifically tailored and told us exactly what models/graphs to use. the final report looks extremely sloppy and is not well written, however it was laid out how the professor wanted it for the course, as he was looking to grade on code implementation and not presentation of information.


The exploritory well data was a final project i submitted for a computational methods class. in it, I use logestic regression and iterative functions to explore a dataset on bengaladeshi well water. this was another project that was heavily directed and told us what models we should be using.

Average Player Index (API) was one of my first coding projects, so the code itself is a bit janky, however, it is one of the most interesting projects to me. My roommate and I used regression from the mean to determine which NBA player is the most average, based on their statistical performance. the scale works such that a player who has the league average in every single stat would have a score of 0, this means that the player closest to 0 is the most average. in our study of the 2021 nba season, Shake Milton was the most average with a score .193, while Nikola Jokic was the leaser average with a score of 2.26.


Fightsimutil is an exerpt of one of the utils from my self-developed game, MMA EMPIRE. This game was largely created using AI, and shows my ability to leverage AI to an extensive level. The game is currently available for pre-sale on Steam.
